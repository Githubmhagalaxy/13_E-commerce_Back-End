# 13_E-commerce_Back-End

# Purpose:
Build the back end for an e-commerce site

# Description:
We use the MySQL and Sequelize packages to connect our Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like our MySQL username, password, and database name.
We Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create our database using MySQL shell commands. We Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like our MySQL username, password, and database name.
Our database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:
• Category
• Product
• Tag
• ProductTag
Also, We need to execute association methods on our Sequelize models to create the relationships between them.
